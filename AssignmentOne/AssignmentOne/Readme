Assignment 1

First Milestone

In the first milestone I learned about structs, variables, foreach loops, system images and navigationview. I have also learnt about journalling in readme and git commits and pushes.

I have implemented these concepts to create a static list of 4 grocery items with a title and some ticked and some not ticked. The files have been pushed to the linked repository below
