Assignment 1

Second Milestone

In the second milestone I learned about datamodels, navigationview, how to delete and append items in a list, how to check and uncheck items, how to uncheck all items and reset items to their previous checked status.

I have implemented these concepts to create a Checklist list that can be added to and deleted as well as a corrosponding item list for each checklist that can be added to, deleted and checked and unchecked and checked status reverted.

There is also documentation in MyDoc as well as struct commentary
